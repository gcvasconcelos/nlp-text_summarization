# Abstractive Text Summarization applied for transcripted brazilian Senators speeches

In this project, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are implemented in an encoder-decoder architecture with the goal to capture context and meaning of a large text with extensive vocabulary and summarize it, using its own words. The code was developed in 2020/2, alongside a report, as the Final Project of Text Mining Course at Bras√≠lia University.


Details of the textpreprocessing strategies and model implementation can be found in the Google Colab code and in the Report
