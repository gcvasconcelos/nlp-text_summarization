# Abstractive Text Summarization applied for transcripted brazilian Senators speeches

In this project, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are implemented in an encoder-decoder architecture with the goal to capture context and meaning of a large text with extensive vocabulary and summarize it, using its own words. The code was developed in 2020/2, alongside a report, as the Final Project of Text Mining Course at Bras√≠lia University.


Details of the textpreprocessing strategies and model implementation can be found in the Google Colab code [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gcvasconcelos/text_summarization/blob/main/text_summarization.ipynb) and in the [Report](https://github.com/gcvasconcelos/text_summarization/blob/main/mt_projeto_final.pdf)
